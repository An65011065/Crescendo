### **Product Vision** (Refined)

**Core Concept:**
Crescendo reveals the sonic landscape around you. It's a real-time music demographic map that shows what people in your vicinity are listening to right now. Discover the musical identity of neighborhoods, cafes, gyms, and campuses.

**Primary Use Case:**
- See what songs are playing around you in real-time
- Understand the music demographic/culture of physical spaces
- Discover music through geography rather than algorithms
- Connect with nearby listeners who share your taste

**Key Differentiator:**
Rather than algorithmic recommendations, Crescendo maps music to physical space. It answers questions like:
- "What kind of music do people in this neighborhood listen to?"
- "What's the vibe of this coffee shop?"
- "Who around me is listening to the same artist?"

**Secondary Features:**
- Echo Sessions: Group listening experiences (local/global)
- Social connections based on proximity and music taste
- Music discovery through real-world exploration
- Privacy controls for anonymous listening

**Technical Achievement:**
- Real-time geospatial data visualization
- Spotify API integration with live playback tracking
- Scalable location-based clustering
- Privacy-first design with granular controls
